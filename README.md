# Photo-scraping Scandal of IBM
In this document, IBM's photo-scraping scandal of 2019 will be discussed. The scandal occurred when IBM scraped and shared 1 million photos from the photo-sharing app Flickr without consent from the site users. Two articles will be analyzed due to their differing perspectives on the issue. 

## 1. NBC News

In the NBC News [article](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/facial-recognition-s-dirty-little-secret-millions-online-photos-scraped-n981921) written by Olivia Solon, a number of negative opinions on the IBM scandal was included. Namely, civil rights advocates are concerned for miniorities who may be profiled in a certain way or targeted. There is also a concern for protecting the right to privacy of individuals, since the photos from Flickr were taken without the consent or knowledge of the users, even though it was publicaly available data.  

It seems that more of the negative opinions on surrounding the IBM scandal have to do with the use of the photos rather than the scraping of the photos. I think that this means that the public is not well informed on how or why the photos will be used to better face-recognition technology. If that is thoroughly explained, including information on how minorities will not be targeted by the technology, then it may alleviate some public fear. The public should also be made aware of who is going to use their photos—people in academia, companies, etc. This may also help gain the public's trust and understanding. 

## 2. MIT Tehcnology Review

In the MIT Technology Review [article](https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/03/15/136593/ibms-photo-scraping-scandal-shows-what-a-weird-bubble-ai-researchers-live-in/) written by Karen Yao, Yao defends IBM by claiming that IBM did what anybody in the AI community would do—collect data to train their machine learning algorithms. Yao writes that scraping data from sources made available to the public is the "industry standard," and so the negative public opinion surrounding IBM's scandal boils down to a cultural misunderstanding between the public and the AI industry. While it is a viable practice to scrape public information, Yao suggests that the emergence of AI at such an unprecedented scale necessitates a change in how the AI industry informs the public of their practices. 

I agree with Yao's perspective on the scandal. As a member of the general public, I can understand how disconcerting it may be to have photos of my face used by companies without my knowledge. However, as a member of the Data Science community, I can also understand that it was necessary for IBM to use the photos in order to better their face-recognition techonology. I believe that the public outcry against IBM is not so much due to their use of publicly available photos as it is due to their lack of communication before using the photos. IBM should bear the responsibility to inform the public and allow for any unwilling users to express their opinions.
